# UC-Swipes

## Getting Started
To get started with using our repository:
1. Clone this repository using the `git clone` command.
2. Change the directory to `./frontend` using the shell command `cd frontend`.
3. Install the needed dependencies in this directory using `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start` to start the frontend. A new window should automatically open in your default browser. If it doesn't, go to `http://localhost:8080`.
5. Open another terminal at the root directory of this repository which should be called `UC-Swipes`.
6. Change the directory to `./backend` using the shell command `cd backend`.
7. Install the needed dependencies in this directory using `npm install`.
8. Run `npm start` to connect to the backend server. Once you see the messages `Server listening on port 8080` and `Connected to DB` in the terminal, you are good to go.
10. Head back to the frontend page that was opened on your default browser and enjoy our app!
